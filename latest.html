        <h2>Importance of Preservation</h2>
        <p>
            Besides retaining the ability to play games from the past, preservation of video games enables research
            on the history
            of video games as well as ways for developers to look at older games to build ideas from. There is also
            interest in
            the preservation of cancelled video games that were known to be in development, as coupled with the
            reasons for cancellation, they can provide an understanding of the technical and creative aspects, or
            lack thereof, at the time of
            the game's development.
