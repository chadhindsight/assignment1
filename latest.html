            Besides retaining the ability to play games from the past, preservation of video games enables research
            on the history
            of video games as well as ways for developers to look at older games to build ideas from. There is also
            interest in
            the preservation of cancelled video games that were known to be in development, as coupled with the
            reasons for cancellation, they can provide an understanding of the technical and creative aspects, or
            lack thereof, at the time of
            the game's development.

            It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when
            looking at its
            layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as
            opposed to using
            'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web
            page
            editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many
            web sites
            still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on
            purpose
            (injected humour and the like).
